            <h1>Covid-19 Visualizations and Predictions Using Machine Learning</h1>
            
            <p class="project">To understand and visualize the effects of Covid-19 on a global scale, we conducted a detailed study of the pandemic using Exploratory Data Analysis and predicting the further course of the pandemic by trained machine learning models. Our objectives include analyzing the spread trend of Coronavirus globally and find useful patterns in the growth rate and spread of the pandemic to help nations to curb the spread of the virus by studying the localized patterns in their nations.

                <li> Analyzing the correlation between confirmed cases and deaths to give an overview of the severity of the virus any region and how likely is it to infect a person living in that region and several other factors.</li>
                <li> Helped raise awareness about the importance of COVID-19 vaccination for public health, the economy and broader society.</li>
