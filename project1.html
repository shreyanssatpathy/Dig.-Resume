            <h1>Covid-19 Visualizations and Predictions Using Machine Learning</h1>
            
            <p class="project">The purpose of CoviGen is to provide a sustainable and efficient solution to the medical industry by predicting the results of Covid 19 using Chest X-rays. The system is based on CNN which uses machine learning algorithms on vast datasets of lung related diseases to predict whether a person is suffering from covid 19 or not. Since X rays deal with the department of Radiology, our product identifies complex patterns automatically thereby helping doctors to analyse cases and take intelligent decisions in a much efficient manner. Above all, we hope to provide an accurate and long-term solution to the medical industry which will in turn help in battling the ongoing pandemic</p>
            
            
            <ul>
                <li>A Convolutional Neural Network based model to predict Covid-19 positive cases from X-Ray Images.Reduces detection rate by over 99%.</li>
                <li>The model was integrated with a responsive front-end interface with latest UI/UX design principles to improve cognitive response rates by 50% among medical practitioners.</li>
                <li> Achieved an accuracy of 99.2% in the deployed CNN Model.</li>
